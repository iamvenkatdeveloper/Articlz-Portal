        "article_data": "<p>For years, scientists have been working out ways to navigate across the lunar surface, a task that’s been a herculean undertaking without tools like the GPS we have on Earth.  </p><p>Since the moon has a much thinner atmosphere than Earth, it’s difficult to judge both the distance and size of faraway landmarks as there’s a lack of perspective from the horizon. Trees or buildings on Earth offer hazy but helpful points of reference for distance, but such an illusion is impossible on the moon. Additionally, without an atmosphere to scatter light, the sun’s bright rays would skew the visual and depth perception of an astronaut on the moon, making it a real challenge to get around the vast, unmapped terrain. </p><p>On Earth, “we have GPS, and it’s easy to take advantage of that and not think about all the technology that goes into it,” says Alvin Yew, a research engineer at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “But now when we’re on the&nbsp;moon, we just don’t have that.” </p><p>Inspired by previous research on lunar navigation, Yew is developing an AI system that guides explorers across the lunar floor by scanning the horizon for distinct landmarks. Trained on data gathered from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the system works by recreating features on the lunar horizon as they would appear to an explorer standing on the surface of the moon. </p><p>“Because [the moon] has no atmosphere, there’s not a lot of scattering of the light,” says Yew. But by using the outline of the landscape, “we’re able to get a very clear demarcation of where the ground is relative to space.” </p><p>Yew’s AI system would be able to navigate using geographic features like boulders, ridges, and even craters, whose distance would normally be difficult to accurately locate for a person. These measurements could be used to match features identified in images already captured by astronauts and rovers, in a similar way to how our GPS spots locations on Earth. Developing GPS-like technology that’s specifically tuned to help explorers get around the moon is especially important for supporting autonomous robotic operations, Yew says. Now that NASA’s Artemis I mission recently finished with a successful splashdown earlier this month, such technology will also be needed for humans to return to the moon in the not-so-distant future. When astronauts of the upcoming Artemis III mission make landfall, having handheld or integral systems to help conquer the new terrain could be the deciding factor in how far (and how well) they can explore, both on the moon and beyond. </p><p>“NASA’s focus on trying to get to the moon, and eventually to Mars someday, requires an investment of these vital technologies,“ says Yew. His work is also planned to complement the moon’s future “internet,” called LunaNet. The framework will support communications, lunar navigation operations, as well as many other science services on the moon. According to NASA scientists, the collection of lunar satellites aims to offer internet access similar to Earth’s, a network that spacecraft and future astronauts can tap into without needing to schedule data transfers in advance, like space missions currently do. </p>",

        "article_description": "Flood damage doesn’t go away when the waters do—these weather events also make it harder to find food. ",
        "article_data": "<p>Following this summer’s devastating floods in the United States, European Union, and a “monsoon on steroids” that left one-third of Pakistan under water, it is becoming increasingly clear that rising floodwaters are a dangerous part of our future with continued climate change. The collateral damage doesn’t go away when the flood waters recede. There is emotional trauma and post traumatic stress disorder, expensive material loss, and a study published today in the journal <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em> is taking a closer look at the affects of all this excess water on food insecurity.</p><p>The authors examined more than a dozen countries across western, eastern, and southern Africa and found that flooding can affect food security for over 5.6 million people across the continent.</p><p>“Our findings show that floods can impact food security both immediately and in the months after the flood event,” Connor Reed, a former New York University Center for Data Science graduate student and lead author on the study, said in a press release. “In many flood events we assessed, there were substantial damages to infrastructure, croplands, and livestock, which compromised food production and access, as well as water resources and sanitation also critical to food security.”</p><p>Between 2009-2020, the researchers studied how key flood characteristics, including location, duration, and extent, influence the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) scale. This is a food insecurity metric used by USAID’s Famine Early Warning System. It measures the severity of food insecurity using a five-point scale, ranging from minimal food security (IPC 1) up to famine (IPC 5). Approximately 12 percent of those who experienced food insecurity were affected by flooding’s devastating impacts over the 2009 to 2020 timeframe included in the study.</p><p>However, there were some beneficial impacts that remedied food insecurity, depending on the time period and regional scale.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our results suggest that floods can have opposing effects on food security at different spatial scales, particularly at time periods after they occur,” study co-author Weston Anderson, a research scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland’s Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center, said in a press release. “In a given year, excess precipitation may immediately lead to floods that destroy crops in a localized area while also being associated with beneficial growing conditions that boost crop production on the country-scale.”</p>",

        "article_description": "Tip: The cheese board is your friend. ",
        "article_data": "<p>Chestnuts roasting on an open fire and the smell of cookies wafting through the air can only mean one thing—the holidays are here. For many, this is a time to see family and get some much needed R&amp;R. But for people with diabetes, the food-filled celebrations can be a bittersweet reminder of what you can and can’t eat.</p><p>Having Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes doesn’t mean you have to miss out on all the goodies, however. <em>Popular Science</em> spoke with diabetes experts who agree that you can treat yourself this season—as long as you do it in moderation. “It’s okay to indulge on the holidays. They’re special,” says Carolyn Maxwell, an endocrinologist at Stony Brook Medicine in New York.</p><p>If you’re going over to a friend’s or family’s holiday dinner, there are several ways to prepare. For example, you can snack throughout the day so you’re not starving when it comes time for the big meal: Having something in your system makes you less likely to binge eat unhealthy foods, says Melissa Gaynor, a dietitian at the Pediatric Diabetes Center at NYU Langone’s Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. You’ll also want to avoid an excess amount of carbohydrates in your main course. Holiday dinners often have turkey, stuffing, and mashed potatoes in their lineups—all of which are high in glucose-producing molecules. Gaynor says that eating a large amount of these savory dishes at one time can make it tricky to control blood sugar levels, even if you’re regularly taking insulin.&nbsp;</p><p>While a few carb-loaded bites won’t severely harm your health, says Gaynor, you might want to ask the host for the recipes in advance so you can keep track of what you’re eating. “There are so many websites and apps where you can type in the ingredients of a recipe and it will tell you the nutritional content and the carbs so you don’t have to guess,” she adds. Foods with a low glycemic index—a measure of how quickly they affect your blood glucose levels—are typically healthy for diabetes.</p><p>If you want more options at a communal meal, Gaynor recommends making your own dish. Not only would you have something you can definitely eat, but you’ll also know the nutritional contents without extra research. Consider bringing a veggie platter or a side such as roasted cauliflower to the party.</p>",

        "article_description": "We live in a universe of extremes.",
        "article_data": "<p>Why is space so cold if the sun is so hot? Excellent question. Unlike our mild habitat here on Earth, our solar system is full of temperature extremes. The sun is a bolus of gas and fire measuring around 27 million degrees Fahrenheit at its core and 10,000 degrees at its surface. Meanwhile, the cosmic background temperature—the temperature of space once you get far enough away to escape Earth’s balmy atmosphere—hovers at -455 F. How can this be?</p><p>Heat travels through the cosmos as radiation, an infrared wave of energy that migrates from hotter objects to cooler ones. The radiation waves excite molecules they come in contact with, causing them to heat up. This is how heat travels from the sun to Earth, but the catch is that radiation only heats molecules and matter that are directly in its path. Everything else stays chilly. Take Mercury: the nighttime temperature of the planet can be 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit lower than the radiation-exposed day-side, according to NASA.</p><p>Compare that to Earth, where the air around you stays warm even if you’re in the shade—and even, in some seasons, in the dark of night. That’s because heat travels throughout our beautiful blue planet by three methods instead of just one: conduction, convection, and radiation. When the sun’s radiation hits and warms up molecules in our atmosphere, they pass that extra energy to the molecules around them. Those molecules then bump into and heat up their own neighbors. This heat transfer from molecule to molecule is called conduction, and it’s a chain reaction that warms areas outside of the sun’s path.</p><p>Space, however, is a vacuum—meaning it’s basically empty. Gas molecules in space are too few and far apart to regularly collide with one another. So even when the sun heats them with infrared waves, transferring that heat via conduction isn’t possible. Similarly, convection—a form of heat transfer that happens in the presence of gravity—is important in dispersing warmth across the Earth, but doesn’t happen in zero-g space.</p>",

        "article_title": "Ukraine’s answer to Russian tanks involves a classic tactic: metal ‘hedgehogs’",
        "article_description": "These tank traps are also known as Czech Hedgehogs, and their use dates back to the 1930s. Here's how they work. ",
        "article_data": "<p>When Russia launched its war on Ukraine on February 24, it did so with missiles and helicopters. Not far beyond, stretching for miles, was the slower work of armored vehicles. Tanks and artillery, brought to staging areas near the border over several months, rolled into Ukraine. With them the war moved from an attack to an invasion, and some people in Ukraine set to work building defenses against the advancing army.</p><p>In Lviv in western Ukraine, locals started assembling anti-tank metal barriers, Agence France-Presse reported. The form, which looks like a child’s toy jack made out of steel I-beams, is known as a “steel hedgehog.” Early versions of this obstacle date back to defensive fortifications built in Czechoslovakia in the 1930s. Some of these Czech fortifications may even have been repurposed by the occupying German forces as barriers on the Normandy beaches before D-Day. It is this use that lends the obstacle the name “Czech Hedgehog,” which is how the Ukrainians that AFP interviewed in Lviv referred to what they were creating.&nbsp;</p><p>A US Army Engineer School correspondence course on fortifications describes steel hedgehogs as “relatively lightweight for the obstacle effect they provide, and they are quickly installed or removed. They are designed to revolve under wheeled vehicles and puncture them or to belly up tracked vehicles. Unless kept under observation and covered with fire, the enemy can readily move them aside.”</p><p>The last line is key: Steel hedgehogs are an especially minor obstacle if they are not actively defended, as they can be lifted, towed, or even rolled out of place, opening a path. If, however, the steel hedgehog row is defended by soldiers, it can add extra protection to infantry, and reduce one of the main advantages of armor.</p><p>Tanks, along with other heavier vehicles like armored personnel carriers, are at their most effective when they have the freedom to move. A turreted gun is a powerful weapon, and in open environments like plains,&nbsp;soldiers on foot are at a huge disadvantage against vehicles.</p><p>Move into any kind of denser terrain, and tanks have less freedom to operate. Trenches, fighting in forests, narrow roads through marshes, and any fighting in cities all compound the circumstances where a tank might struggle in combat. Given the choice to fight through a path with hedgehog obstacles in it or go around, tanks with an ability to reroute will likely do so.</p><p>Should they drive forward, they risk driving onto one of the hedgehogs. When a tank does drive over a hedgehog, the obstacle rolls under the tracks and lodges in the vehicle, lifting the tank in the air. If a tank does get stuck on such a trap, it’s a sitting target until it can be towed away, and its crew would be faced with the choice to evacuate under fire or sit and hope no one with anti-tank weapons finds them.</p>",

        "article_title": "Rusty metal could be the battery the energy grid needs",
        "article_description": "We need more ways to store renewable energy. Is it time for metal-air batteries to shine? ",
        "article_data": "<p>Electricity is highly perishable. If not used at the moment it is created, it rapidly dissipates as heat. Full decarbonization of the electric grid can become a reality only when vast amounts of solar and wind energy can be stored and used at any time. After all, we can’t harness renewable energy sources such as solar and wind 24/7.</p><p>At present, lithium-ion batteries make up a considerable chunk of the market for energy storage. But they are expensive, involve mining rare metals, and are far from environmentally sustainable. Finding an alternative that is less ecologically degrading is crucial—and so far, scientists are analyzing replacements for lithium-ion batteries with the help of raw materials such as sodium, magnesium, and even seawater. But in the last few years, the energy industry has been investing in metal-air batteries as a next-generation solution for grid energy storage.&nbsp;</p><p>Metal-air batteries were first designed in 1878. The technology uses atmospheric oxygen as a cathode (electron receiver) and a metal anode (electron giver). This anode consists of cheap and abundantly-available metals such as aluminum, zinc, or iron. “These three metals have risen to the top in terms of use in metal-air batteries,” says Yet-Ming Chiang, an electrochemistry professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1932, zinc-air batteries were the first type of metal-air battery, widely used in hearing aids. Three decades later, NASA and GTE Lab scientists tried to develop iron-air batteries for NASA space systems but eventually gave up. Still, some researchers are chasing after the elusive technology.</p><p> Researchers believed that, theoretically, metal-air batteries could have higher energy density than lithium-ion batteries for more than six decades. Still, they have repeatedly failed to live up to their full potential in the past.</p><p>In a lithium-ion battery, the process of power generation is straightforward. Lithium atoms merely bounce between two electrodes as the battery charges and discharges.&nbsp;</p><p>Involving air, however, makes the process more tricky, and adds an added challenge—the difficulty in recharging. Oxygen reacts with the metal, creating a chemical that then sets off the electrolysis process, discharging energy. But instead of a reaction that can go back and forth, in metal-air batteries, the transfer is most of the times only one way. Thanks to the constant flow of atmospheric oxygen into a metal-air battery, once you start it up, the battery can corrode quickly even when left unused and have a stunted shelf life.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, metal-air batteries’ watt-hours per kilogram—that measures the energy storage per unit of the battery’s mass—is not currently exceptionally high. This is the main reason why electric vehicles now cannot utilize metal-air batteries such as iron-air, Chiang tells <em>Popular Science</em>. <strong>“</strong>Lithium-ion batteries have 100 watt-hours per kilogram. But for iron-air, it was only 40 watt-hours per kilogram. The rate at which energy is stored and then discharged from the battery is relatively low in comparison,” he says. </p>",

        "article_description": "That's a whopping amount of Big Macs.",
        "article_data": "<p>Imagine you begin pedaling from the&nbsp;start of Stage 17&nbsp;of&nbsp;this year’s Tour de France. First, you would bike approximately 70 miles (112 km) with a gradual increase in elevation of around 1,300 feet (400 m). But you’ve yet to hit the fun part: the&nbsp;Hautes-Pyrénées mountains. Over the next 40 miles (64 km) you would have to climb three mountain peaks with a net increase of a mile (1.6 km) in elevation. On the fittest day of my life, I might not even be able to finish Stage 17—much less do it in anything remotely close to the five hours or so the winner will take to finish the ride. And Stage 17 is just one of 21 stages that must be completed in the 23 days of the tour.</p><p>I’m a sports physicist, and I’ve&nbsp;modeled the Tour de France&nbsp;for nearly two decades using terrain data—like what I described for Stage 17—and the laws of physics. But I still cannot fathom the physical capabilities needed to complete the world’s most famous bike race. Only an elite few humans are capable of completing a Tour de France stage in a time that’s measured in hours instead of days. The reason they’re able to do what the rest of us can only dream of is that these athletes can produce enormous amounts of power. Power is the rate at which cyclists burn energy and the energy they burn comes from the food they eat. And over the course of the Tour de France, the winning cyclist will burn the equivalent of roughly 210 Big Macs.</p><h2>Cycling is a game of watts</h2><p>To make a bicycle move, a Tour de France rider transfers energy from his muscles, through the bicycle and to the wheels that push back on the ground. The faster a rider can put out energy, the greater the power. This rate of energy transfer is often measured in watts. Tour de France cyclists are capable of generating enormous amounts of power for incredibly long periods of time compared to most people.</p><p>For about 20 minutes, a fit recreational cyclist can consistently put out&nbsp;250 watts to 300 watts. Tour de France cyclists can produce&nbsp;over 400 watts for the same time period. These pros are even capable of&nbsp;hitting 1,000 watts&nbsp;for short bursts of time on a steep uphill—roughly enough power&nbsp;to run a&nbsp;microwave oven.</p><p>But not all of the energy a Tour de France cyclist puts into his bike gets turned into forward motion. Cyclists battle air resistance and frictional losses between their wheels and the road. They get help from gravity on downhills but they have to fight gravity while climbing.</p><p>I incorporate all of the physics associated with cyclist power output as well as the effects of gravity, air resistance, and friction&nbsp;into my model. Using all that, I estimate that a typical Tour de France winner needs to put out an average of about 325 watts over the roughly 80 hours of the race. Recall that most recreational cyclists would be happy if they could produce 300 watts for just 20 minutes.</p>",

        "article_title": "Everything you thought you knew about tetanus is wrong",
        "article_description": "What’s rust got to do with it? Very little. ",
        "article_data": "<p>The conversation in which your parents tell you to keep an eye out for rusty nails is basically a rite of passage. They tell you about the dangers of rust; explain the see something, say something protocol for things that look like they could puncture you; and foreshadow the harsh punishment for disobeying—lockjaw.</p><p>This advice certainly comes from a good place. But it’s also fundamentally wrong.</p><p>This is not to say that tetanus isn’t as bad as parents promise. In North America, the Cleveland Clinic estimates, 10 percent of cases are fatal. In countries with inadequate or inaccessible medical care, the number is believed to be much higher.</p><p>Even survival takes its toll. On Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a new installment in its “Notes from the Field” series about an unvaccinated 6-year-old boy in Oregon who contracted tetanus after he got a cut in his forehead. The bacteria incubated inside his little body for a few days, then suddenly manifested in horrible jaw clenching and muscle spasms, heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature irregularities. He lived, but only after 57 days in the hospital and more than $800,000 in medical bills.</p><p>But counter to what rusty nail warnings might have you believe, the disease has nothing to do with iron oxide, the chemical compound more commonly known as rust. Rather, tetanus is a product of the bacteria <em>Clostridium tetani</em>, which is in dirt, dust, and feces—in other words, everywhere. It can enter your body through puncture wounds, yes, but also through superficial cuts, bug bites, surgical procedures, and any other rupture to your skin. It can come from stepping on a rusty nail, or tending the soil in your garden. That’s why it’s so essential to track your booster shots: You need one every decade, not just when you rip your palm open on a rusty chain link fence. Waiting for a classic tetanus injury won’t work when <em>anything</em> could, in theory, be a tetanus injury.</p><p>If the bacteria enter your body and you aren’t up-to-date on your vaccinations, the tiny invaders begin to multiply rapidly. This incubation period, which lasts between three and 21 days, according to the CDC, is symptom free. But as the bacteria begin to die inside you, they form a neurotoxin that attacks the nervous system. Specifically, it inhibits the chemical GABA, which regulates muscle contractions. The result is a body-wide state of tension, from lockjaw in your face to uncontrollable arching spasms in your back to permanently-curled toes.</p><p>How rusty nails came to be so closely associated with tetanus isn’t clear. Iron oxide is basically harmless to the human body; millions of people drink water transported by rusty iron pipes with no health effects. (Bridges aren’t so lucky—rusting has buckled many an iron span.) Perhaps it’s some classic American folklore. Or, as Esther Inglis-Arkell argued on the site <em>i09,</em> it has something to do with the anaerobic environment in which the tetanus-causing <em>Clostridium tetani</em> bacteria thrives. As iron oxidizes, it eats up atmospheric oxygen, creating a low-oxygen environment for the bacteria to grow. While rust doesn’t cause tetanus, the two may have a symbiotic (and symbolic) relationship.</p><p>For thousands of years, tetanus plagued humankind. Hippocrates, the ancient Greek physician, mentioned the disease in his works. But in 1884, researchers discovered how the disease worked, and just 40 years later, scientists had developed a vaccine. Today, three shots and a booster every 10 years is basically 100 percent effective at preventing tetanus, whether it’s contracted from a seemingly-clean kitchen knife, a diaper change, or a rusted-up nail. The best part? It’s not too late to get yours. Make sure your booster shots are up to date!</p>",

This will not be one of them. We know these gardening staples aren’t always easy to come by, especially if you live in a city. Thankfully, there are some veggies that can regenerate using water and sunlight alone.&nbsp;</p><p>The premise behind regrowing vegetable scraps in water is simple: plants are generally built to harness energy from the sun and nutrients from the earth. A small glass or dish of water won’t provide the same nutrients as hearty soil, but plants can still use it to grow new tasty shoots or soil-ready roots.</p><h2>Plants that will grow shoots</h2><p>You can easily regrow the edible stems and leaves of some common kitchen veggies by simply placing their inedible base in water. For best results, position these stumps on a sunny windowsill and change the water frequently.</p><h3>Lettuce and cabbage</h3><p>Chances are, you usually discard that tough white chunk at the base of a head of cabbage or lettuce once you’ve torn off all its leaves for your salad. But by placing this part in water, you can coax out some new leaves. Put it in a wide mug or shallow bowl with an inch or two of water, leaf-side up, and check it often to make sure the outside isn’t getting slimy. Within a week or two, new baby leaves should start sprouting from the center of the stump. Your homegrown head won’t return to its full leafy glory, but this can be a great way to grow garnishes or supplement a larger dish.</p><h3>Celery and leeks</h3><p>Most stores and markets sell celery and leeks with their bases still attached, sometimes with little white roots already dangling out. This makes these veggies super simple to regrow: just prop the bases up in a small glass with about an inch of water at the bottom and wait for new stalks to emerge. Be sure to top up the water when it gets low—but don’t waterlog the plant by submerging too much of the base. Your new sprouts will be skinnier than the originals, but even a small amount of these crunchy crops can add flavor to a wide array of dishes.</p><h3>Garlic and green onions</h3><p>While you won’t get garlic or onion bulbs themselves to regenerate without soil, these aromatic plants can sprout flavorful green shoots in water alone. Place a single clove of garlic in a small cup of water, suspending it with toothpicks so the bottom is underwater but the top isn’t. Do the same with the bottom few inches of a green onion, or scallion. Within a few short days, you should start to see signs of green growth emerging. You can harvest these scallions and garlic shoots (called scapes) with regular kitchen scissors, and keep watering them to produce even more.</p>",

        "article_data": "<p>Artificial intelligence is getting cheaper, better at the tasks we assign it, and more widespread—but concerns over bias, ethics, and regulatory oversight still remain. At a time when AI is becoming accessible to everyone, the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence put together a sweeping 2022 report analyzing the ins and outs of the growing field. Here are some of the highlights.</p><h2>A growing number of publications</h2><p>The number of publications alone on the topic tell a story: They doubled in the last decade, from 162,444 in 2010 to 334,497 in 2021. The most popular AI categories that researchers and others published on were pattern recognition, machine learning, and algorithms.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, the number of patent filings related to AI innovations in 2021 is 30 times greater than the filings in 2015. In 2021, the majority of filed patents were from China, but the majority of patents actually granted were from the US.</p><p>The number of users participating in open-source AI software libraries on GitHub also rose from 2015 to 2021. These libraries house collections of computer codes that are used for applications and products. One called TensorFlow remains the most popular, followed by OpenCV, Keras and PyTorch (which Meta AI uses).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Computers that analyze images and understand speech</h2><p>Specifically, out of the various tasks that AI can perform, last year, the research community was focused on applying AI to computer vision, a subfield that teaches machines to understand images and videos in order to get good at classifying images, recognizing objects, mapping the position and movement of human body joints, and detecting faces (with and without masks). </p>",
