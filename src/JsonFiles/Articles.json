        "article_description": "When it comes to working out, you know that what you do in the gym is important. But what you do outside the gym — what you eat, what you drink, and especially how you sleep, is just as crucial. In fact, you must sleep in order for exercise to actually work.",
        "article_data": "“We exercise for a purpose: for cardiovascular health, to increase lean muscle mass, to improve endurance, and more. All of these ‘goals’ require sleep,” says W. Christopher Winter, MD, the president of Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine and the author of The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep Is Broken and How to Fix It.\n\nWithout sleep, exercise does not deliver those benefits, Dr. Winter explains. “If you don’t sleep, you undermine your body.”",

        "article_description": "The duration of sleep is completely subjective to individual health and circumstances, experts say",
        "article_data": "<p>While it is a universal fact that sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining mental and physical well-being, the number of hours of sleep you require is debatable. While some wake up feeling fresh after barely five hours of sleep, others struggle to ward off sleepiness even after 9-10 or even more hours. </p><p>According to sleep experts, sleep needs vary individually owing to sleep quality, patterns, activity, levels, personal circadian rhythms, and age. “Sleep requirements change according to age, sleep quality, patterns, physical activities, and circadian rhythms. With age being the most dominant factor, the requirement decreases from 16-18 hours of sleep for newborns to 7-8 hours for adolescents. Changing from adult to old age, sleep requirements vary according to lifestyle, work profile, and diseases,” said Dr Yogesh A Gupta, MD (Medicine), Consultant Physician, Sterling Hospital.</p><p>Agreeing, Dr Minesh Mehta, Senior Physician and Critical Care Specialist, Shalby Multispeciality Hospitals, Ahmedabad added that ranging from newborn to the elderly, sleep requirement changes drastically. “However, with no standard prescription fitting all, individuals have subjective sleep requirements. One’s lifestyle with activity levels dictates the number of hours required. For example, athletes are advised to sleep more than normal people. An average adult requires 7-9 hours of sleep for a healthy sleep pattern. Anything below or above regularly is an indicator of poor health,” he explained.</p>",
